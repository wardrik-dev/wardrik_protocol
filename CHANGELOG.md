# Changelog

## 0.1.0-rc.1 (2026-10-30)

- Wardrik's events as CloudEvents: a JSON Schema for each event type, and for the envelope.
- Every operation in one OpenAPI 3.1 document, by its `operationId`, with the action it needs, its
  effect and what it acts on.
- `WardrikProtocol.schema/1`, a schema with every `$ref` inlined, for any JSON Schema validator.
- `operations/0` and `operation/1`, each operation with one `input` schema across its path, query
  and body.
- `types/0` and `dataschema/1`, for every event type.
- Live events, like `message.delta`, marked `x-wardrik-live`: sent as they happen, never stored.
- The typed Elixir functions, like `Wardrik.Agent.ask/3`, that packages built on Wardrik call.
- `Wardrik.Server`, the behaviour for what runs Wardrik's operations.
